# Flyback

Record, replay and mock HTTP requests.   
Flyback is a javascript HTTP recorder written in typescript. Can be used as standalone server or http middleware.
It is created for use in your integration or e2e tests or running your application against mocked HTTP servers.

## Api

### FlybackServer(options)

#### start([callback])
Starts the HTTP server.

#### close([callback])
Stops the HTTP server.

### createFlybackMiddleware(options)

## Tapes
Tapes can be freely edited to match new requests or return a different response than the original. They are loaded recursively from the `tapesPath` directory at startup if specified.   
It is not necessary to specify tapesPath, you can generate tapePath from request, it can be helpful in testing with puppeteer, you can add header with test path, and tapes will be loaded from there and written to that path

#### Format
All tapes have the following 2 properties:   
* **req**: Request object. Used to match incoming requests against the tape.
* **res**: Response object. The HTTP response that will be returned in case the tape matches a request.

You can edit any part of the tape through tapeDecorator option.   
Flyback doesn't watch tape files so if you will change them in runtime, changes wont be applied

#### Tape names and grouping
New tapes will be created under the `path` directory with the name `unnamed-n.json5`, where `n` is the tape number.   
Tapes can be renamed at will, for example to give some meaning to the scenario the tape represents.  
If a custom `tapeNameGenerator` is provided, it will be called to produce an alternate file path under `path` that can be based on the tape contents. Note that the file extension `.json5` will be appended automatically.

##### Example:
```javascript
function nameGenerator(tapeNumber, tape) {
  // organize in folders by request method
  // e.g. tapes/GET/unnamed-1.json5
  //      tapes/GET/unnamed-3.json5
  //      tapes/POST/unnamed-2.json5
  return path.join(`${tape.req.method}`, `unnamed-${tapeNumber}`)
}
```

#### Request and Response body
If the content type of the request or response is considered _human readable_ and _uncompressed_, the body will be saved in plain text.      
Otherwise, the body will be saved as a Base64 string, allowing to save binary content.

##### Pretty Printing
If the request or response have a JSON *content-type*, their body will be pretty printed as an object in the tape for easier readability.   
This means differences in formatting are ignored when comparing tapes, and any special formatting in the response will be lost. 
 
## Recording Modes
flyback proxying and recording behavior can be controlled through the `record` option.   
This option accepts either one of the possible recording modes to be used for all requests or a function that takes the request as a parameter and returns a valid recording mode.   

There are 3 possible recording modes:   

|Value| Description|
|-----|------------|
|`NEW`| If no tape matches the request, proxy it and save the response to a tape|
|`OVERWRITE`| Always proxy the request and save the response to a tape, overwriting any existing one|
|`DISABLED`| If a matching tape exists, return it. Otherwise, don't proxy the request and use `fallbackMode` for the response|
            
The `fallbackMode` option lets you choose what do you want flyback to do when recording is disabled and an unknown request arrives.  
Same as with `record`, this option accepts either one of the possible modes values to be used for all requests or a function that takes the request as a parameter and returns a mode.

There are 2 possible fallback modes:   

|Value| Description|
|-----|------------|
|`NOT_FOUND`| Log an error and return a 404 response|
|`PROXY`| Proxy the request to `host` and return its response, but don't create a tape|

It is recommended to disable recording when using flyback for test running. This way, there are no side-effects and broken tests fail faster.

flyback exports constants for the different options values:
```javascript
  const flyback = require("flyback")
  
  const opts = {
    record: flyback.Options.RecordMode.OVERWRITE,
    fallbackMode: flyback.Options.FallbackMode.PROXY
  }
```

## Custom request body matcher
By default, in order for a request to match against a saved tape, both request and tape need to have the exact same body.      
There might be cases were this rule is too strict (for example, if your body contains time dependent bits) but enabling `ignoreBody` is too lax.

flyback lets you pass a custom matching function as the `bodyMatcher` option.   
The function will receive a saved tape and the current request, and it has to return whether they should be considered a match on their body.   
Body matching is the last step when matching a tape. In order for this function to be called, everything else about the request should match the tape too (url, method, headers).   
The `bodyMatcher` is not called if tape and request bodies are already the same. 

### Example:

```javascript
function bodyMatcher(tape, req) {
    if (tape.meta.tag === "fake-post") {
      const tapeBody = JSON.parse(tape.req.body.toString());
      const reqBody = JSON.parse(req.body.toString());

      return tapeBody.username === reqBody.username;
    }
    return false;
}
```

In this case we are adding our own `tag` property to the saved tape `meta` object. This way, we are only using the custom matching logic on some specific requests, and can even have different logic for different categories of requests.   
Note that both the tape's and the request's bodies are `Buffer` objects.

## Custom request URL matcher
Similar to the [`bodyMatcher`](#custom-request-body-matcher), there's the `urlMatcher` option, which will let you customize how a request and a tape are matched on their URL.

### Example:

```javascript
function urlMatcher(tape, req) {
    if (tape.meta.tag === "user-info") {
      // Match if URL is of type /users/{username}
      return !!req.url.match(/\/users\/[a-zA-Z-0-9]+/);
    }
    return false;
}
```
  
## Custom response decorator
If you want to add a little bit of dynamism to the response coming from a matching existing tape or adjust the response that the proxied server returns, you can do so by using the `responseDecorator` option.      
This can be useful for example if your response needs to contain an ID that gets sent on the request, or if your response has a time dependent field.     

The function will receive a copy of the matching tape and the in-flight request object, and it has to return the modified tape. Note that since you're receiving a copy of the matching tape, modifications that you do to it won't persist between different requests.   
flyback will also update the `Content-Length` header if it was present in the original response.   

### Example:
We're going to hit an `/auth` endpoint, and update just the `expiration` field of the JSON response that was saved in the tape to be a day from now.      

```javascript
function responseDecorator(tape, req) {
  if (tape.meta.tag === "auth") {
    const tapeBody = JSON.parse(tape.res.body.toString())
    const expiration = new Date()
    expiration.setDate(expiration.getDate() + 1)
    const expirationEpoch = Math.floor(expiration.getTime() / 1000)
    tapeBody.expiration = expirationEpoch

    const newBody = JSON.stringify(tapeBody)
    tape.res.body = Buffer.from(newBody)
  }
  return tape
}
```

In this example we are also adding our own `tag` property to the saved tape `meta` object. This way, we are only using the custom logic on some specific requests, and can even have different logic for different categories of requests.   
Note that both the tape's and the request's bodies are `Buffer` objects and they should be kept as such.    

## Exit summary
If you are using flyback for your test suite, you will probably have tons of different tapes after some time. It can be difficult to know if all of them are still required.   
To help, when flyback exits, it will print a list of all the tapes that have NOT been used and a list of all the new tapes. If your test suite is green, you can safely delete anything that hasn't been used.
```
===== SUMMARY (My Server) =====
New tapes:
- unnamed-4.json5
Unused tapes:
- not-valid-request.json5
- user-profile.json5
```
This can be disabled with the `summary` option.
